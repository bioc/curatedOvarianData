0.2.0:
* Added E-MTAB-386 (FFPE samples with survival data)
* put MaxMean probe mappings in eset@featureData
* put official Bioconductor platform names in eset@annotation

0.2.1:
* In the TCGA dataset, about 40 censored patients had days_to_death and days_to_recurrence labelled as NA instead of the follow-up time.
* TCGA released updated clinical information for six patients
* Levi reviewed Ina and Svitlana's double-checks, which resulted in minor changes to GSE18520 (for all patients changed debulking_status from NA -> optimal, stage IV -> III, and grade 4 -> 3)

0.2.2:
* replace GSE17260, which went missing in 0.2.1

0.2.3:
* Rename "celfile_run_date" and "batch_1" to "batch", and get rid of "batch_2" and "batch_3" so there is one consistent batch variable
* consistently label missing debulking status as "NA" rather than sometimes as "unknown"
* for FULL version, replace the missing probesets (probesets not found in the probeset-gene map were missing in previous versions)
* addition of unit test for sample counts (not actually working yet)

0.2.4:
* TCGA: replaced batch variable which disappeared
* GSE9891: corrected days_to_death and days_to_recurrence for three patients where an error occurred in copying uncurated data from supplemental PDF to create source .csv file.

0.3.0:
* Added GSE32062.GPL6480 and GSE32063 (Yoshihara et al. 2012), "Japanese datasets A and B" (issue #6).
* GSE13876: Got rid of recurrence_status, which was just a copy
  of vital_status.  No recurrence status is available for this study.
* resolved missing ExperimentData for GSE2109 and GSE6822 (issue #9)
* Added subtype information (serous) for PMID17290060, PMID19318476, PMID15897565 (issue #11)
* Turned Markus's dataset-check test to R CMD check unit test

0.4.0:
* Added GSE30009 (Taqman qPCR dataset).

0.4.1:
* Added ages to GSE26712 (Bonome 08).
* Use getPlatformsBiomaRt for GSE6822, to avoid using HGNC symbols directly from GPL80 [Hu6800]

0.4.2:
* 0.4.1 actually did not include ages for GSE26712, but this version
does.

0.5.0:
* disallow the use of "unknown" in template, use NA instead.
Affected subtype, debulking, primarysite, arrayedsite.
* added unit test which does syntax checking against template.

0.99.1:
* Fixed expO short title, now: expO, IGC 2005
* Changed template to make distinction between T (1-3) of the TNM
  staging, and FIGO tumorstage (I-IV), which we still code as 1-4.
  This affected the metadata of every dataset which has stage.
* Some datasets specified only early/late stage and high/low grade,
  and some of these had been guessed (ie 2 for early, 4 for late).
  Now, we DO NOT guess unspecified stage or grade, but curate these
  under summarystage and summarygrade.  Affected GSE12470, GSE13876,
  GSE18154, and GSE26712.
* Added tumorstage based on calculation from T+M for GSE2109.
* Remove curation files for GSE3149, GSE7463 which are not in curatedOvarianData.
* Rescued some incorrectly recorded uncurated stage data in GSE6008 (1
  and I both tumorstage 1).
* Updated the BLAST reference genome to GRCh37.68 (from 64).  This
  affects GSE12470_eset, GSE13876_eset, and GSE17260_eset.
  Streamlined blast_gene_maps.R so this update can be made simply by
  changing the ftp address of the genome map.
* Updated BioMart probeset <--> gene maps (Oct 9, 2012).  Previous versions used
  BioMart as of June 27, 2012.
* Publication metadata was missing from GSE30009 - no longer require complete cases for
  MIAME in createEsets.R.
* Made test_counts.R unit test work for Normalizer and FULL versions.
* When technical replicate samples have a piece of non-agreeing sample
  metadata, set the value for this sample to NA.  Only affected one
  grade 2 or 3 sample in GSE13876, which kept template syntax unit test
  from passing.
* added batch variable to PMID17290060 (Dressman et al.)

0.99.2:
* added tumorstage and summarystage to GSE26712 from additional spreadsheet.

0.99.10: Addition of TCGA-mirna-8x15kv2 and GSE30161.

0.99.20:
* added percent_stromal_cells, percent_tumor_cells, and percent_normal_cells
* added uncurated_author_metadata
* removed T, N, M, chemo_response, inferred_chemo_response
* renamed G to grade, subtype to histological_type
* defined optimal debulking as <10mm for TCGA (was: No Macroscopic Disease)

0.99.21:
* When merging technical replicates, if a metadata field has "///" and
  it disagrees between the replicates, try to merge rather than just
  setting to NA.

1.0.0:
* per-dataset documentation fully automated, replaces
  manually-generated documentation.
* several additions to vignette - comBat example, Table 1 of
  manuscript, and a section for non-R users.
* added grade and summarygrade that was missing for Crijns (GSE13876).
* added summarygrade to Bentink (E.MTAB.386) from paper (all high).
* more metadata put in ExpressionSets: featureData(eset)@other now
  contains rich platform information and warnings.  This all makes it
  into automatic documentation.
* Changed typo in experimentData(TCGA_eset)@name "Cancer GenomeAtlas
  Network" to "Cancer Genome Atlas Network"
* Fixed featureData slot of FULLVcuratedOvarianData, which was
  previously missing gene symbols.

1.0.1:
* curate newly available grade for GSE17260 (Yoshihara 2010)

1.1.0:
* add p-values for forest plots to the figure captions.
* change curatedOvarianData to NormalizerV, FULLV for the alternative
  packages in inst/extdata/*
* For GSE18520 (Mok), change debulking from all "optimal" to all "NA".
* Added GSE8842: all early-stage samples on a custom/commercial
  Agilent two-color cDNA array.
* Added citation to paper published in DATABASE, for citation("curatedOvarianData")

1.1.1:
* added options to createEsets.R: remove.retracted and remove.subsets

1.2.0:
* added RNA-seq data for TCGA, updated gene maps.

1.2.1:
* TCGA sample type "11" samples now correctly curated as "healthy"
  instead of "adjacentnormal"

1.2.2:
* added section "Non-unique gene symbols" to the vignette.
* updates to createEsetList.R to catch it up to the PMID24700801 version (www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/ovrc4_sigvalidation) - mainly option to manually remove certain studies or patients
* inst/extdata/patientselection.config by default now removes the same duplicate samples as PMID24700801.

1.3.0:
* added several new datasets (GSE26193, GSE49997, GSE44104, GSE51088)
* added debulking status to Mok (GSE18520)
* curated LMP and borderline tumors as "borderline" and benign tumors
  as "benign" in sample_type.  Affected GSE2109, GSE30009, GSE49997,
  GSE51088, GSE6822, GSE8842, GSE9891.
* improved specificity of platform_accession, e.g. GSE20565_eset is
  GPL570 only, not GPL570|GPL2005|GPL6801 (change made in
  etc/ovarian_cancer_public_datasets.csv)
* Renamed technology_type column to platform_technology in
  etc/ovarian_cancer_public_datasets.csv, so this makes into
  experimentData(eset).
* Upgrade from Ensembl release 68 to release 76 for blast gene maps,
  re-create Biomart gene maps on Aug 25 2014

1.3.1:
* added missing grade to GSE26913
* createEsetList.R now does scaling and variance filtering of genes
before removing any samples from the ExpressionSet.

1.3.2:
* Update all gene maps

1.5.2:
* Fix library(logging) bug and remove.samples bug in createEsets.R.
