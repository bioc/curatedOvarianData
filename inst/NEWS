curatedOvarianData is a comprehensive resource for clinically-oriented
investigation of the ovarian cancer transcriptome.  It provides
clinically-annotated expression data for 2,908 patients at the time of
publication, as 24 datasets originating from 22 studies, including
publicly available microRNA and Affymetrix mRNA microarray data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  All probesets are mapped to official
gene symbols using up-to-date maps.  All clinical annotations are
hand-curated and machine-checked to ensure consistent syntax, allowing
efficient selection of patient subsets with desired clinical
annotations and characteristics.
